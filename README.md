The **`AIProgrammingAssistant`** class is designed to streamline the interaction between users and AI while programming. Its main purpose is to make it easier for developers to document and share their codebase along with contextual comments and conversations with the AI. 

### Key Functions:

1. **Snapshot Codebase**: It captures the current state of the project’s codebase, allowing users to easily gather all relevant code and comments in one place for AI processing.

2. **View Snapshots**: Users can review their codebase snapshots to understand the project’s state at various points, ensuring clarity before sharing with AI.

3. **Conversation Logging**: The tool logs conversations between the user and the AI, enabling developers to provide specific context and insights about their code, which can improve the AI's responses and suggestions.

4. **Export Data**: Users can export the codebase and conversation logs into a single file, making it convenient to share with the AI for analysis, debugging, or enhancement tasks.

5. **Interactive Menu**: The application offers a user-friendly interface, allowing developers to navigate and perform actions seamlessly, such as adding comments or viewing logs.

Overall, the **`AIProgrammingAssistant`** serves as a bridge between human developers and AI, facilitating efficient programming workflows by allowing easy documentation and contextual sharing of code and insights.
